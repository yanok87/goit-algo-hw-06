Task_2 Analysis:

The Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm traverses as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. In this case, it explores the path from Kyiv to Vienna via Lutsk, Lviv, Warsaw, and Munich. It prioritizes going deeper into the graph before exploring other branches.

On the other hand, the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. In this graph, BFS explores all the immediate connections from Kyiv first before moving on to deeper levels. Hence, it traverses paths from Kyiv to all its neighboring cities before exploring further.

The key difference lies in how each algorithm prioritizes exploration. DFS goes deep into the graph, while BFS explores nodes at the same depth level before delving deeper.
